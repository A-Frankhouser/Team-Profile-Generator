## <b> <u> Usage: </b> </u>

Once everything is installed then move into the integrated terminal of the index.js file. Once in here type "node index.js". It will then ask you a series of prompts starting with the manager. After completing the manager prompt, it will ask you if you would like to add an Engineer or Intern. After selecting one of the options and answering the prompts, it will then ask if you would like to add another employee. If you answer yes, then it will ask if you would like to add an Intern or Engineer. If you select no, then it will generate an html file under the "dist" folder with your cards. <br />

To run the tests open up the integrated terminal of index.js and type in "npm test". This will run tests on the employee, manager, intern, and engineer script.
